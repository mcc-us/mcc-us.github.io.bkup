Tips from 'Bard'

## Basics:

- **Double-entry bookkeeping**: Every transaction affects two (or more) accounts, a debit and a credit. The total Debits always equal the total Credits.
- **Accounts**: Imagine accounts as containers for different financial elements like assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses.

## General Rules:

- **Using 'T-Accounts'**: 

**Draw out T-accounts for each account in a transaction.**  

| Account ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit   | Credit    |

**Label the left side "Debit" and the right "Credit."**
- This can help you solidify the pairing as you see the impact on each account.  



**Assets increase with Debits, decrease with Credits**
  - Think of Debits as depositing money into the asset account, while a Credit is a withdrawl.

| Assets ||
|:--------|----------:|
| Debit + | Credit (-)|

**Liabilities increase with Credits, decrease with Debits** 

|| Liabilities |
|:----------|--------:|
| Debit (-) | Credit +|
