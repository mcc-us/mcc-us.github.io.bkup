**LEFT-RIGHT RULES**

  - **LEFT Increases asset accounts.**

  - **RIGHT Increases revenue accounts.** 
  
'Fee-Income' or 'Revenue' are recorded on right side of accounts.
  
It's important to understand that debits and credits represent changes to specific accounts based on their economic nature (assets, liabilities, etc.).

**It's best to remember:**

Debits increase the "giving" sides (assets and expenses) and decrease the "taking" sides (liabilities, equity, and revenue).

Credits decrease the "giving" sides and increase the "taking" sides.
