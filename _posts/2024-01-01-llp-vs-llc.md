Key differences between: Limited Liability Partnerships Vs. Limited Liability Company

Here's a breakdown:

**Structure:**

- LLP: **Partners share profits and losses according to predefined agreements**. 
  - They are typically formed by professionals like lawyers, accountants, or doctors.
- LLC: **Offers more flexibility, allowing for both partnership and corporate-like characteristics**. 
  - Members can choose to share profits and losses proportionally or based on specific agreements, similar to an LLP, or elect for fixed shares, like in a corporation.

**Liability:**

- LLP: **Partners can still be held liable for their own negligence or malpractice.** Partners have limited liability for the partnership's debts and obligations. 
- LLC: **Members enjoy limited liability for the LLC's debts and obligations, regardless of their individual actions** or negligence (except in rare cases of piercing the corporate veil).

**Management and Governance:**

- LLP: **Typically managed by partners** who share decision-making responsibilities. Some states may require specific governance structures, such as managing partners.
- LLC: **Can be managed by members, managers (appointed by members), or a combination**. LLC operating agreements outline management structure and decision-making processes.

**Taxation:**

- LLP: Profits and losses pass through to partners' individual tax returns, **avoiding double taxation**. LLPs are treated as partnerships for tax purposes. 
- LLC: **LLC can elect corporate taxation status if desired**. Offering flexibility in choosing taxation. By default, LLCs are also taxed as partnerships.  This can be beneficial for larger LLCs or those with substantial profits.

**Other Considerations:**

- Transferability of Ownership: 
  - **LLPs may have restrictions on transferring ownership interests**, while 
  - **LLCs generally offer more flexibility in transferring membership** interests.

- Formation and Maintenance: 
  - LLPs may have specific formation and ongoing regulatory requirements depending on the profession or state. 
  - LLCs generally require less paperwork and ongoing formalities.
