### GAAP 4 Assumptions

1. **Separate Entity** - Personal acts always separated from business acts
2. **Going Concern** - Business will continue to cover its obligations and debts, etc
3. **Monetary Unit** - Information is ONLY expressed in monetary terms
4. **Periodicity of Income** - Activities are separated into periods: monthly, quarterly, or yearly

### GAAP 4 Major Principles

1. **Historical Cost basis** - Past amounts or market value determine values of assets or liabilities
2. **Revenue Recognition** - Revenue is recognized when it is earned (delivery of service or good) and realized (cost received) 
3. **Matching** - Revenue and Liabilities are matched to the 'period' they occurred.
4. **Full Disclosure** - Full, relevant, honest and open monetary information

### More GAAP

- GAAP is developed by Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB).
- Standards can be changed by petitioning FASB. It's more common for the FASB to initiate changes based on research, public input, and emerging issues.
  - **Exposure draft** describes proposed changes, **discussion memorandum** followed by **Accounting standards Codification** implementation
- The SEC requires **publicly traded companies to comply** with GAAP
- GAAP recommends that publicly traded companies have their financial statements audited by independent auditors.
- Auditors produce report on the operation and financial position of the business
- Audits should be:
  - Timely, accurate and fair
  - Assets and liabilities should be objectively determinable
