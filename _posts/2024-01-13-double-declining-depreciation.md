## How to in 3 steps

DDB = (2 / Useful Life) x Book Value at Beginning of Period

Key components:

- *2*: Slope is twice of linear depreciation rate.
- *Useful Life*: The estimated number of years an asset will be used.
- *Book Value*: Value at purchase

**Example**: Your company buys a $50k truck. How much is depreciation?

### Step 1 - Write down your known info

| Double-Declining Depreciation Example ||
| :--- |-----: |
| Asset name/description | truck |
| Depreciation method | double-declining depreciation   |
| Asset initial cost | 50,000 |
| Residual (salvage) value | 10,000 |
| Useful life | 5 yr |

<br>

### Step 2 - Calculate the Depreciation Rate

DDB Depreciation Expense = (2 / Useful Life) x Book Value at Beginning of Period

| Straight Line Depreciation Example ||
|---:|-----:|
| 2 * Depreciation rate / year = 2/5 | 40% |

### Step 3 - Build Depreciation Schedule/Table

| Year | Opening Value | Depreciation Expense | Accumulated Depreciation | Closing Value |
|---:|--------:|--------:|--------:|--------:|
| 1  | $50,000 | $20,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| 2  |  30,000 |  12,000 |  32,000 |  18,000 |
| 3  |  18,000 |   7,200 |  39,200 |  10,800 |
| 4  |  10,800 |   4,320 |  43,520 |   6,480 |
| 5  |   6,480 |   2,592 |  46,112 |   3,888 |

Notes:

- *Declining Book Value*: Each year's depreciation expense is calculated based on the asset's remaining book value at the beginning of that year, resulting in decreasing depreciation amounts over time.
- *Salvage Value*: If a salvage value is expected at the end of the asset's life, it's typically ignored in DDB calculations until the final year.
- *Switching to Straight Line*: In some cases, DDB depreciation might be switched to straight-line depreciation in later years to avoid depreciating the asset below its salvage value.
