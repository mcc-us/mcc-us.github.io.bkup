4 alternative depreciations

Non-linear depreciation methods account for factors like usage, technological advancements, or obsolescence. 

Examples:

1. *Units-of-production*: Depreciation is based on the number of units the asset produces, resulting in higher depreciation during periods of high activity.

1. *Sum-of-the-years digits*: Each year receives a decreasing depreciation fraction based on the remaining useful life, with higher weights assigned to earlier years.

1. *Declining balance with variable rate*: The depreciation rate can be adjusted based on factors like expected usage or asset performance, providing more flexibility.

1. *Modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS)*: Commonly used in tax accounting, this method assigns specific depreciation rates to different asset classes, reflecting their expected decline in value.

Choosing the appropriate non-linear depreciation method depends on the specific nature of the asset, its usage patterns, and the desired level of accuracy.
