Q. What order are financial statements prepared? and Why?

1. **Income statement <- Rev - Exp = Net**    

   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total** 
<br>    

2. **Equity <- Common Shares + Retained Earnings - Dividends - Drawings**  

   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total**   
<br>

3. **Balance Sheet <- A = L + SE**  

   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total**  
<br>

4. **3 Financial Ratios - Current, Debt & Equity ratios**  

<br>

All reports use: **WHO, WHAT, WHEN**
