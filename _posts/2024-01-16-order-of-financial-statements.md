Q. What order are financial statements prepared? and Why?

1. **Income statement <- Rev - Exp = Net**    
   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total** 
    

2. **Equity <- Common Shares + Retained Earnings - Dividends - Drawings**  
   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total**   


3. **Balance Sheet <- A = L + SE**  
   - 3 Columns: **Act, Amount, Total**  


4. 3 Financial Ratios - **Current, Debt & Equity ratios**  

<br>

All reports use: WHO, WHAT, WHEN
