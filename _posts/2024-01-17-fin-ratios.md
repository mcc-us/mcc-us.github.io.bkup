how to calculate

1. Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities
   - **Anything > 1.5 is good**
    
2. Debt Ratio = Total Liabilities / Total Assets

3. Equity Ratio = Total S.E. / Total Assets

*Examples:*

1. Credit ratio = 6,500/3,800 = 1.71   


2. Debt ratio = 48,800/136,500 = 35.8%   

3. Equity ratio = 1- Debt ratio = 87,700/136,500 = 64.2%
