how to calculate

1. **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities   
   - *Anything > 1.5 is good*   
<br>
2. **Debt Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Assets   
<br>
3. **Equity Ratio** = Total S.E. / Total Assets

*Examples:*  

1. **Current ratio** = 6,500/3,800 = 1.71     
<br>
2. **Debt ratio** = 48,800/136,500 = 35.8%     
<br>
3. **Equity ratio** = 1- Debt ratio = 87,700/136,500 = 64.2%
