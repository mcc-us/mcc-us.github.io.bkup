Five common types of adjustments can vary depending on the business. 



2. *Depreciation Expenses*: This adjustment allocates the cost of an asset over its useful life as an expense. It ensures the asset's cost isn't recognized all at once but gradually spread over time. It benefits the business as the investment is being used.

3. *Accrued Expenses*: These adjustments recognize expenses incurred but not yet paid, resulting in a liability. 

4. *Accrued Revenues*: These adjustments recognize revenue earned but have yet to be recorded because cash has yet to be received. 

5. *Deferred Revenues*: These adjustments recognize cash received in advance for services you still need to provide. For example, suppose you receive a subscription payment in December for January access. In that case, you'd need to defer the revenue in December and record a deferred revenue liability.
