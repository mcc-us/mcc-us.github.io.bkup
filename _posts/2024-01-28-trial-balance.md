Trial balances promote accuracy, identify potential issues, facilitate financial statement preparation, and serve as an internal control.   

### Steps

1. Enter the general ledger account names.   

2. Enter the ending balance of each account in either Debit or Credit column.   

3. Total the Debit and Credit columns to prove that the trial balance is in balance.   

4. Compare the total debits with the total credits, **Net differences between debits & credits.**   

5. Double underscore under each Trial Balance column to show that the work in that column is complete.   

### Notice that the trial balance has four new accounts:   

1. Accumulated Depreciation—Equipment,  
2. Supplies Expense,   
3. Rent Expense,    
4. Depreciation Expense—Equipment.   


### Rules for Presentation:

1. Balance sheet assets are arranged on the bases of liquidity. 
  - Cash always appears first followed by marketable securities, accounts receivable, supplies, inventory, prepaid items then fixed assets (which appear in the order of longevity).   

For example, store equipment, office equipment, buildings and land would appear in the order presented under fixed assets.   

2. Liability accounts appear based on their earliest due date.   
  - Consequently A/P always appear first followed by notes payable and mortgages payable.   

3. Income statement accounts, both revenues and expenses appear in alphabetical order.

### Key benefits it offers:

1. Verifies Accuracy: The fundamental purpose of a trial balance is to check for mathematical errors in your accounting records. By ensuring the total debits equal the total credits, you gain confidence that the basic recording of transactions is correct. This saves time and effort compared to manually rechecking every entry.

2. Identifies Potential Issues: While a balanced trial balance doesn't guarantee error-free accounts, it can uncover inconsistencies and missing entries. If the totals don't match, it indicates an error somewhere in your system, prompting you to investigate and rectify the issue before proceeding further.

3. Provides Overview of Financial Position: The trial balance summarizes the balances of all your accounts, offering a snapshot of your financial position at a specific point in time. You can quickly see your total assets, liabilities, equity, income, and expenses, gaining a high-level understanding of your business's financial health.

4. Aids in Financial Statement Preparation: The trial balance forms the foundation for preparing financial statements such as the balance sheet and income statement. By having all the balances readily available, you can easily transfer them to the appropriate statements, saving time and ensuring consistency.

5. Internal Control Tool: Regularly preparing trial balances serves as a form of internal control. It promotes discipline and accuracy in daily bookkeeping and helps prevent errors and fraud from going undetected.

6. Communication Tool: The trial balance can be used as a communication tool for stakeholders like managers, investors, or auditors. It provides a concise overview of the company's financial standing, facilitating discussions and decision-making.

Overall, a trial balance is a valuable tool at various stages of the accounting process. It promotes accuracy, identifies potential issues, facilitates financial statement preparation, and serves as an internal control measure.
