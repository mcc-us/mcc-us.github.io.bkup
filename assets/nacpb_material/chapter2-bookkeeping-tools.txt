CHAPTER 2

Bookkeeper Tools

Introduction

This chapter introduces the bookkeeping, payroll, and accounting tools utilized in our Accounting System.

Accounting Analytics utilizes the leading support, bookkeeping, payroll, and accounting tools. We utilize technology, hardware,
and applications that maximize efficiency and productivity.

The tools are categorized as Support, Bookkeeping, Payroll, and Accounting tools.

Support Tools

Personal Computer

A personal computer (PC) is the most versatile and efficient tool in just about any present-day vocation. If the user is stationary, a
desktop PC is the most versatile PC. If the user is mobile, a laptop PC is the most versatile PC. If a person is stationary and mobile,
they generally have a desktop and a laptop PC.

The pros of a desktop are the ease of upgrading components in the larger housing, larger display(s), full-size keyboard, and
mouse. All great advantages for stationary users. However, if the user is mobile, the pros become the cons. It is difficult to
transport the larger desktop housing and the external larger display(s), full-size keyboard, and mouse. Thus, the laptop PC. The
laptop was developed for mobility.

The pro of a laptop is the smaller size of the housing and its internal display, keyboard, and touchpad. However, like the desktop,
the pro becomes the con. The smaller size of the housing and its internal display, keyboard, and touchpad are not as user-friendly
when compared to a desktop.

Accounting Analytics professional personnel are both stationary and mobile. They prefer the stationary advantages of a desktop
and the mobility advantage of a laptop. Therefore, to obtain both advantages, our professionals have larger displays, full-size
keyboards, and mice where they are most stationary (at the office for some and at home for others), and a laptop for when
mobile.

Instead of investing in a desktop and a laptop, our professionals only invest in a laptop. However, when stationary, they connect
their laptop to a docking station or dock to obtain the advantages of a desktop.

When some individuals think of a docking station, they think of the old, clunky docking stations where they insert and encase their
laptops into the docking stations. However, today’s docking stations are external devices that connect their laptops to their
peripheral devices with a single connection cable.

Dual Monitors

To maximize productivity, a bookkeeper should use a dual monitor setup. This involves having two monitors set up and used
simultaneously side-by-side. Doing this makes it much easier to organize, manage, and perform work by being able to display
multiple programs or pages at a time.

We use dual monitors to use an application on the right and reference the documentation on the left. For example, when
performing a bank reconciliation, we display the QuickBooks Reconcile page on the right monitor and the bank statement on the
left, allowing us to reference the bank statement as we perform the reconciliation.

‘With Windows 10, you can do this with one monitor splitting the screen, but you have limited visibility.
Additional advantages of using dual monitors include:

Increased productivity
Reduction in errors
Using two applications simultaneously

Sharing data between applications

ow Ne

Comparing data on one monitor to data on the other monitor

It is also helpful to have dual monitors that allow you to adjust the monitors from a horizontal to a vertical position when viewing
certain documentation such as a tax return.

Cloud Computing

Cloud computing is the ability to access, store, manage, and process data on a network of remote servers (data centers) hosted
on the Internet, rather than on a personal computer or local server. The Cloud is a metaphor for the Internet. Cloud computing is
storing and accessing applications and data over the Internet instead of your computer's hard drive. The user accesses the Cloud
via an Internet-connected device such as a computer, tablet, or phone. For example, QuickBooks Online is a Cloud-based
application. You access the application and manage and process your stored company data through an Internet-connected
device.

The benefits of Cloud computing are as follows:

« Safe storage (never losing data to hardware issues or disasters)

« Ease of access (access the application and data at any time and from anywhere with any Internet-connected device)
« Shared access (share your application and data with associates or clients)

« Up-to-date software (when you access Cloud software, it is the latest version)

« Little to no maintenance or hardware costs.

Microsoft 365

Microsoft 365 (formerly Microsoft Office 365) is a cloud-based subscription service that combines Word (word processing), Excel
(spreadsheets), Outlook (email), and PowerPoint (presentations), with OneDrive (Cloud-based file storage service). The
subscription allows users to create and share documents at any time and anywhere on any device.

Microsoft 365 has two subscription plan categories: Home and Business. Home has Family (up to 6 people) and Personal (1

eCommerce Website

A website is a collection of web pages of codes that describe the layout, format, and content on a page. A website resides on a
web server. A web server is an Internet-connected computer that receives a request for a web page sent by a web browser. A web
browser connects your device to the web server through an IP (Internet Protocol) address

An eCommerce website is a website with eCommerce functionality that allows customers or clients to purchase and pay for
products or services via the Internet.

Your website should increase your sales and receipts. It should also integrate with your accounting system so you can gather,
record, and classify sale and receipt transactions and your accountant can analyze, summarize, interpret, and communicate sales
and receipt information.

Online Bank and Credit Card Accounts

Online bank and credit card accounts allow you to access, manage, and process your bank and credit card accounts with an
Internet-connected device such as a computer, tablet, or phone.
